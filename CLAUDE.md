# CLAUDE.md — artha-web

Guidance for working in this repository.

## What this is

React SPA for Artha Science, consuming the `artha-platform` API. Private and
single-user: no SEO, no SSR, no multi-tenant auth. Built to static files and
served by Caddy.

Platform-level decisions and their reasoning are in `../PLATFORM-DECISIONS.md`.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # needs the artha-platform compose stack running on :80
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
docker build -t artha-web:local .
```

## Rules

- **Relative API paths only.** `fetch("/api/…")`. No base-URL environment
  variable: the dev proxy and Caddy both serve the API on the same origin, so
  introducing one only creates a way to misconfigure it.
- **All HTTP goes through `src/api/`.** Components call typed functions; they
  never call `fetch` themselves. When the API grows, generate that layer from
  the platform's OpenAPI schema so the contract is a build artifact rather
  than something two repositories agree on by hand.
- **Charts plot server-computed series.** TradingView Lightweight Charts, not
  Advanced Charts — the latter carries its own indicator engine, which would
  duplicate the rule engine and quietly disagree with it on warm-up periods,
  gaps and corporate-action adjustment. The chart's job is to show why a
  signal fired, so it must display the values the rule actually used.
- TypeScript is strict, including `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. ESLint runs type-aware rules.

## Gotchas

- **Vitest and Vite majors must match.** Vitest 2 bundles Vite 5; with Vite 6
  that produces two copies of Vite's types and `defineConfig` fails to
  typecheck under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. Vitest 3 pairs with Vite 6.
- **Import `defineConfig` from `vitest/config`,** not `vite`, or the `test`
  key is rejected as an unknown property.
- `npm install` warns that esbuild's postinstall was skipped. Benign —
  esbuild ships prebuilt binaries through optional dependencies.
- `index.html` must be served `no-cache` while hashed assets are immutable,
  or a deploy stays invisible until browser caches expire. That is configured
  in `Caddyfile`.

## Not yet built

Everything past the placeholder shell: routing, the instrument and signal
views, Lightweight Charts integration, TanStack Table. `src/App.tsx` exists
only to prove the deployed frontend reaches the API through the same proxy
that serves it.
